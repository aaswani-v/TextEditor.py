I have tried to make a text-editor which is terminal based, no GUI (for now atleast),
Reason to make this "it was quite easy to create on terminal and easy to execute"
You can create any type of text based file using it:
  1. .html or any Proggramming (ofc no syntax highlighting and no Auto Completion (coause it's a simpel text editor)
